OMD-nexus7 - run your Nagios server on a Nexus 7 tablet
OMD package & source for Asus Nexus 7 tables running Ubuntu 12.10
Based on ompistro for Raspberry Pi by Gerhard Lausser (see https://github.com/lausser/ompistro )

Putting this up here for two reasons:
- I think it's important to support diversity. 
  Github can't be the one-to-rule repository. Besides, gitoriours and bitbucket 
  are both more fun and more stable than Github.
- I had to make a few changes that were breaking the original ompistro. Most
  probably that was just since this is a first time ever :>
