I happened to see the XIV can be monitored using snmp. 
From what I saw so far the XIV only exposes a very sad amount of information
via SNMP. But since we just do monitoring, not storage management: even a
"xivmachinestatus" is sufficient to see if the machines' status is not OK,
Right?

I'll be adding a proof of concept check here.

It makes me kinda happy I was right that SNMP is just a sad joke
for monitoring storage. kudos.
