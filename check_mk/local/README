All these files must be placed in $MK_LIBDIR/local - 
and MK_LIBDIR is defined in the Agent script itself.

On some OS it'll just be set to /change/me - so you really need to check.

Set the MK_LIBDIR to a place that suits well with your distro.

i.e. 
most linux: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent
FreeBSD /usr/local/lib/check_mk_agent
HP-UX /opt/check_mk/lib
...

then create a "local" folder in there and copy in the scripts.
They need to be executable.
