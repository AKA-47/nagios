There are two agent modes:

For checking over-the-wire using ssh-keyscan, there's one agent plugin.
This needs to be given a list of hosts to scan and will then do it's thing.
It's built as a piggyback agent so the services are assigned to the correct
hosts.
This can actually trip MITM attacks as the comparism of whatever is seen
over the wire is done on the monitoring server.

Alternatively you can use a per-node version that just greps the right
keys in /etc/ssh and sends it with the normal agent data.
This is just fine - *except* for a different use case.
A MITM won't be recognized, but it will at least detect sloppy sysadmins 
migrating a server and forgetting to restore the old keys.
